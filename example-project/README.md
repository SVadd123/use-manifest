# use-manifest example

This project attempts to be a mostly-understandable usage of use-manifest.

It has also helped greatly with sorting out use-manifest's type system without pulling in a much
bigger project ðŸ˜Š

All you should have to do to get started is `npm ci && npm run start`

## Troubleshooting!

There can be some wonk with multiple react dependencies and whatnot.
If the example seems to be mysteriously crashing or has bizarre type errors, try deleting
use-manifest/node_modules/ and maybe redo `npm ci` here in example-project before trying
`npm run start` again.

You may find yourself using a pattern like
```
cd ..; npm ci && npm run build && rm -rf node_modules && cd example-project; npm ci && npm run start
```

...note that this command assumes you're running from already within the example-project directory.

I'm not going to tell you this is beautiful, but it should mostly work.
